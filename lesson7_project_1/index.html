            <h2><em><strong>Overview</strong></em></h2>
            <p>News about the hacking group that is called FIN7 has recently surfaced due to the arrests of three of its members. They are one of the most advanced, financially driven hacking groups there is at the time, and they use very detailed and strategic methods to target their victims. While there is not an exact amount on how much money this group has made, it is estimated at well over a billion dollars. FIN7 has attacked more than just payment card industries, such as restaurants and hospitality, but also energy, education, telecommunications, and the government to name a few.</p>
            <p>The lengths FIN7 has gone to so that they could achieve and conceal their hacking sprees has been the most astonishing for people. They are very cautious and make sure even the smallest details are in line so that their hacking attempts are very hard, if not impossible, to detect for the targets. They have even gone as far as inventing their own new techniques which has not been done before on such a large scale for hacking.  </p>
            <p>One example of how FIN7 goes about attacking their target is by pretending to be a customer/interested prospect of a specific company. They will start small by sending an email to an employee with something like a complaint, reservation request, order, etc. With the email they will include a link or document stating that it has important information in regards to their email. Sometimes they won't even send the link/document in the first email, but send it after a few emails were made back and forth. Once the target clicks on the link, the file will typically reside and occur in memory instead of downloading on a disk because it is harder to detect. After that, there is no telling how much information FIN7 will be able to acquire, or even when it will be detected that they have hacked into the company's system.</p>
            <p>The three members that were arrested are Dmytro Fedorov, Fedir Hladyr, and Andrii Kopakov. The men supposedly held higher roles within FIN7; one being a system administrator, and the other two being supervisors. Although the arrest of these men have not stopped operations for FIN7, it has been a step in the right direction to hopefully learn more information about the inner workings of the group.  </p>
